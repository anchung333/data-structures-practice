## Trees
  - strengths:
    - Dynamic data structures: easy to add/remove additional data
    - structure conveys information: following a path gives information about the tree's structure
  - heap = root is most important node. 
  - recursive definition: tree is either empty, or has a key, and has children which are also trees
    - optional: parent pointer
  - binary tree: left, right child keys, optional parent key. 
  - descendents of a tree include children of children of children, etc. 
  - siblings: nodes that share the same parent
  - leaf: node that has no children
  - forest: collection of trees
  - depth-first: traverse all the way down one sub-tree to a leaf before exploring sibling
    - inOrderTraversal: would print left-most leaf, then print its parent, then print its right sibling. (for a BST)
    - preOrderTraversal: visit node itself, print node, then visit left, then right
    - postOrderTraversal: just print node itself last, but otherwise similar to preOrderTraversal
    - utilizes a stack
  - breadth-first: traverse all nodes of height/level n before going to next level
    - utilizes a queue
    - LevelTraversal: visit node, enqueue its children, then visit children, doing the same until leaves are reached
