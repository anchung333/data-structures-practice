## Arrays
 - One chunk of memory that's equally divided
 - Core language feature; don't have to reference outside framework/library to create array
 - Key feature: O(1) access to read/write (just need to know number to access any element's value in array)
   - Formula: arr_address + (element_size_in_memory * (index - first_index)) => location of any element
 - Flexibility: constraints on size, type of elements within array will keep overhead down. Flexibility will introduce additional overhead and potentially performance/memory tradeoffs compared to a constrained array.
 - Multi-dimensional arrays: O(n) access.
   - array_add + element_size[(curr_row_ind - first_row_ind) * # of elements per row + (curr_col_index - first_col_ind)] => element_address
   - col-major vs row-major ordering
 - Linear Array time complexities for common ops:
   - beginning: add (O(n)), remove (O(n))
   - end: add (O(1)), remove (O(1))
   - middle: add (O(n)), remove (O(n))
 - Since array = object, need variable to reference array object in order to manipulate/do things
 - Sieve of Erathosthenes
   - start with 2, work until n ^ (1/2) (square root of n) and cross off all #'s < n divisible by i as not prime.
 - Multi-dimensional arrays (AKA Matrix/Table):
   - 2-D array: Pascal's Triangle
   - 3-D Array: Array of Arrays of Arrays (weather[1][2][3])
     - additional dimensions: think of cell phone bill...just wrapping more arrays in arrays of arrays...etc
 - Dynamic arrays (not really applicable to JS? All arrays are already dynamic)
   - static arrays of static size are...static
   - solution? initialize a pointer to an array, and initialize new array + copy over new array over old so pointer 
     refers to new array
   - Methods: 
     - Get(i): get element at index i
     - Set(i, val)
     - PushBack(val): like push...add to end of array
     - Remove(i): remove element at idx i
     - Size(): get size of array
 - Jagged Array (array of arrays):
   - like a 2D array, but can have varying row sizes unlike traditional 2D Array
 - Resizable Array (already a feature of arrays in JS)
